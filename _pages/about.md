I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. [Alan Scheller-Wolf](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/scheller-wolf-alan.html), Prof. [Sridhar Tayur](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/tayur-sridhar.html), and Prof. [Alan Montgomery](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/montgomery-alan.html). I earned a [Master's degree in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) from [CMU's School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/).  Before I came to CMU. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). 

My research is centered around developing innovative machine learning algorithms and optimization tools for important applications such as organ allocation, child welfare, and financial services.

More details can be found on my [CV](../files/Tang_Yanhan_20230601.pdf).
