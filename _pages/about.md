I am an Assistant Professor of [Information Technology and Operations Management](https://www.smu.edu/cox/academics/information-technology-and-operations-management-department) at [SMU Cox School of Business](https://www.smu.edu/cox). I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Management from the [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), a [Master's degree in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) from [CMU's School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), and another Master’s degree in Operations Management from Tepper. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm).

My research focuses on data-driven decision-making for applications in public services and healthcare, including child welfare, the opioid epidemics, organ allocation, and personalization. I am dedicated to conducting research with a positive social impact.
