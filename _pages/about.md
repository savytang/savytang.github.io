I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. [Alan Scheller-Wolf](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/scheller-wolf-alan.html), Prof. [Sridhar Tayur](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/tayur-sridhar.html), and Prof. [Alan Montgomery](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/montgomery-alan.html). Concurrently, I am pursuing a [Master's degree in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), CMU. Before I came to CMU. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). 


My research interests lie in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), as well as their applications in healthcare and financial services. Currently, I am investigating two areas of focus: a) the application of ML methods in financial services and non-profit operations, and b) the development of analytical models for organ allocation.

More details can be found on my [CV](../files/Tang_Yanhan_20230213.pdf).
