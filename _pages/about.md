I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by Prof. [Alan Scheller-Wolf](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/scheller-wolf-alan.html), Prof. [Sridhar Tayur](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/tayur-sridhar.html), and Prof. [Alan Montgomery](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/montgomery-alan.html). I earned a [Master's degree in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) from [CMU's School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/).  Before coming to CMU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). 

My research concentrates on data-driven decision-making for important real-world applications such as organ allocation, child welfare, and personalization. I am dedicated to conducting operations and artificial intelligence (AI) research for positive social impact. Two main themes of my research are:

* Strategies for allocating critical yet limited resources efficiently and fairly. Specifically, I have developed decision support models for organ allocation, and human-AI teaming in child welfare.
* Adaptive learning algorithms for dynamic environments. I am keen on developing innovative models and algorithms for scenarios involving learning by doing or nonstationary demand patterns. Thus far, I have applied novel algorithms to applications in surgical learning and personalized marketing.
