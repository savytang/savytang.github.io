I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/), at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My research interests include artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), healthcare, and financial services. My current research interests include a) ML methods for financial services and non-profit operations; and b) analytical models for organ allocation.

At CMU, I enjoy learning the frontiers of AI, and I am studying for a [master's degree in ML](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html). Before I came to CMU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Tsinghua University.
